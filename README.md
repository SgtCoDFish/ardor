# ARDOR
ARDOR is a roguelike game build for the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge (7drl) 2018.

The theme is "energy" - all items can be converted into an equivalent amount of energy, which can be used to attack your foes.

Energy is stored in your player, `@` in the form of "caps". Using the torch or cap blasts drains caps, while "capping" items in the inventory replenishes caps.

If you're wasteful with caps, you'll find yourself limited to basic attacks in combat and unable to use your torch to navigate.

Some items are better at replenishing caps than others. You can cap a Sword if you'd like, but it won't be as efficient as a fuel such as Coal or Wood.


## Controls
- Up, Down, Left, Right - Move  (VIM hjkl keys are also supported)
- 'b': Perform a cap blast in a direction you input
- 't': Toggle torch
- 'i': Show inventory (options are available per-item; use up/down to navigate)
- '<': Descend stairs!
